# Acknowledgments

It is my greatest pleasure to thank Gregory Hill and Kerry Thornley, both on behalf of myself and discordian cabals the world over.  Without their humor, wit, and irreverence the Principia Discordia would not exist, a dreadful thought to say the least. Thank you Mal-2.  Thank you Lord Omar. You are missed.
