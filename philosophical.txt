Philosophical Function of the Discordian Society
According to Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst

Once men and women probed the secrets of nature hoping to discover and explain the laws of the universe, to discover the shape and source of order. Today that search is ending. Once it was the function of religion to provide explanations for the things which science discovered but was unable to explain. Today that function is vestigial. 

So interested have man and women been with order that they have left another field entirely neglected: DISORDER.
