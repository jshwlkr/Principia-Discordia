Philosophical Function of the Discordian Society
According to Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst, K. C., Bull Goose of Limbo, High Priest of Erisian Orthodoxy

Once men and women probed the secrets of nature hoping to discover and explain the laws of the universe, to discover the shape and source of order. Today that search is ending. Once it was the function of religion to provide explanations for the things which science discovered but was unable to explain. Today that function is vestigial. 

So interested have man and women been with order that they have left another field entirely neglected: DISORDER.

Why are the secrets of the atom used to promote chaos among men? Why are the most generous motives of men played upon to produce slavery? Why do otherwise sane people attend church on Sunday?

The purpose of The Discordian Society is to provide false, comforting answers to questions of this sort; to give mystical reasons for the disorder around us; to promote unworkable principles of discord--in short to provide the world a workshop for the insane, thus keeping them out of mischief.
