About the Discordian Society

The Discordian Society is a group of people with a common bond, DISCORD. While it is quite true that all people inherently manifest discord (as all people inherently manifest order; the two princilpes being in eternal conflict--which is itself discordant) The Discordian Society itself refers to the elite population.
