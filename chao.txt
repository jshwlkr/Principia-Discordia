The Sacred Chao

The Sacred Chao is the official symbol of the Discordian Society, pictorally symbolizing The Working of The Forces of the Universe.

Utilizing the symbolism of the Taoist Yin and Yang The Sacred Chao is divided into The Hodge and The Podge; only instead of a Podge spot in The Hodge there is a pentagon, to represent The Eristesque Principle; and instead of a Hodge spot in The Podge there is The Golden Apple of Discord, to represent The Eristic Principle.
